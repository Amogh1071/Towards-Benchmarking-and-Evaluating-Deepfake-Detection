# Towards Benchmarking and Evaluating Deepfake Detection

**Course Project (EE656)**
**Instructor:** Prof. Nishchal Verma
**Duration:** May 2025 – July 2025

---

## 📌 Objective

To establish a **rigorous and unified benchmark** for evaluating deepfake detection models, addressing the critical need for **reliable and generalizable detection systems** in the face of increasingly sophisticated synthetic media threats.

---

## 🧩 Strategy

* **Dataset Curation:** Compiled a multi-source dataset incorporating over **12 deepfake generation methods** covering a range of **spatial and temporal manipulation** techniques.
* **Model Development:** Reproduced and fine-tuned **11 state-of-the-art deepfake detection models** across **9 distinct neural architectures**, including both spatial and spatiotemporal approaches.
* **Benchmarking Protocol:** Conducted **640+ controlled experiments** using **6 robust evaluation metrics** (e.g., F1-score, AUC, Precision, Recall) to assess:

  * Generalization performance
  * Cross-domain robustness
  * Metric-level consistency

---

## 🧪 Results

* Compiled and released a **diversified evaluation suite** for future comparative studies.
* Delivered comprehensive insights on **model scalability**, **domain transferability**, and **failure patterns** across varied manipulation types.
* Demonstrated the necessity of **multi-metric analysis** over single-metric benchmarking to avoid misleading performance interpretations.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

* **Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow
* **Libraries:** OpenCV, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
* **Hardware:** NVIDIA A100 GPUs (for large-scale training)

## 📈 Key Takeaways

* A **single-model** is rarely optimal across all manipulation types — architectural diversity is key.
* **Spatiotemporal features** significantly boost detection under complex manipulations.
* Robust benchmarking requires **multi-domain** training/testing, not in-domain only.
